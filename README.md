# Hi, I'm Sirine ðŸ’»

Born and raised in Lebanon, I fluently speak, read, and write English, French, and Arabic.
Graduating with a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 2017 has enabled me to acquire a rich programming skill-set.

During the past 5 to 6 years, I got the oppurtunity to work in <strong>three</strong> different <strong>countries</strong> Lebanon, Dubai, and  Irvine, and created different <strong>web</strong> and <strong>report</strong> projects for several companies, hospitals, retails, and univeristies using different modern and old technologies.

When I'm not coding I play tennis, practice Ice Skating, and go rock climbing. I'm currently trying to achieve my life goal of <strong>travelling</strong> the world!
