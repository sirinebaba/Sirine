# Hi, I'm Sirine ðŸ’»

Born and raised in Lebanon, I fluently speak, read, and write English, French, and Arabic.
Graduating with a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 2017 has enabled me to acquire a rich programming skill-set.

During the past 5 to 6 years, I got the oppurtunity to work in three different countries Lebanon, Dubai, and the U.S., and created different web and report projects for several companies, hospitals, retails, and univeristies using different modern and old technologies.

When I'm not coding I play tennis, practice Ice Skating, and go rock climbing. I'm currently trying to achieve my life goal of travelling the world!
